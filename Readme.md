Keras Tuner Project 🚀

This project demonstrates the use of Keras Tuner
 to optimize hyperparameters for deep learning models. Keras Tuner provides a clean and scalable way to find the best model architecture and training parameters automatically.

📌 Features

Hyperparameter optimization for deep learning models

Support for multiple tuner strategies:

RandomSearch

Hyperband

Automated exploration of:

Number of layers & units

Learning rates

Dropout rates

Optimizers

Evaluation of best models with accuracy & loss visualization
